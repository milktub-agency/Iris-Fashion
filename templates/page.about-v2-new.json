It quickly became the go-to spot in the neighbourhood for their unique edit of chic, independent womenswear brands.<br\/>Four stores and twenty years later, Iris has grown into a beautiful community; a brilliant, all-female team; and a label in its own right: designing romantic collections for the modern woman.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Following success and growth in other London locations, the online store was launched in 2013 bringing the same IRIS aesthetic to a wider audience. With a history and reputation for curating beautiful, branded collections the IRIS team used that knowledge and platform to launch an own-brand IRIS collection in 2016.<\/p>",
